# UFO Sightings on Multiple Criteria

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a site allowing a table built from data imported from a javascript object to be filtered using multiple criteria input by the site user. The filtered table will display as soon as the user confirms the input of a filter (adds a filter value and presses enter).
