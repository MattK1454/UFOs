# UFO Sightings on Multiple Criteria

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a site allowing a table built from data imported from a javascript object to be filtered using multiple criteria input by the site user. The filtered table will display as soon as the user confirms the input of a filter (adds a filter value and presses enter).

## Results

![Table with two filters](https://github.com/MattK1454/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/2%20filter%20table.png)

## Summary

Overall, the added filtering allows for the user to narrow down the list of sightings to specific criteria. One draw back is:
* The user would have to already know what they were looking for in order to achieve maximum benefit from the filter system.

Two possible additions to the site might be:

* Making it so the user can enter what they want in any way (uppercase, lowercase, mixed-case lettering) and still have the table filtered correctly.
* Adding a comments filter option so the user could filter based on descriptions of an event, helping them further filter the table for their desired needs.
